Worst-case Time Complexity of rehash() in HashTable

The worst-case time complexity of rehash() is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.

Explanation:
When rehash() is called, the hash table is resized, and all elements need to be reinserted into the new table. This means iterating over all elements, which takes O(n) time.

Worst-case Time Complexity of removeUser(const string & k) in PassServer

The worst-case time complexity of removeUser(const string & k) is O(n).

Explanation:
The removeUser() function first finds the correct bucket using a hash function (which takes O(1) time).
 In the worst case, all n elements are in the same bucket, so it may need to search through all of them, resulting in O(n) time.

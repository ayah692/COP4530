# Project 4: Binary Tree and Its Application

**Course:** COP4530  
**Due Date:** 11/13/2024  
**Student:** Ayah Halloum

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement a **binary expression tree (BET)** using recursive algorithms
- Convert **postfix expressions** into correctly formatted **infix expressions**
- Analyze algorithm complexity for specific tree operations

This project focuses on data structure design, recursion, and expression handling using binary trees.

---

## Files Included

- `bet.h`: Declaration of the BET class and its public/private interfaces
- `bet.cpp`: Implementation of all BET member functions
- `proj4_driver.cpp`: Driver program for running the conversion
- `assignment6_p4.txt`: Time complexity analysis for `makeEmpty()` and expression conversion
- `makefile`: Builds the executable `proj4.x`

---

## How to Compile

Inside the `project4` folder, run:

```bash
make

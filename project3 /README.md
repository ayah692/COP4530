# Project 3: Stack and Its Applications

**Course:** COP4530  
**Due Date:** 10/30/2024  
**Student:** Ayah Halloum

## Objective

This project focuses on implementing a **generic Stack** container using class templates and applying it to:
- Convert infix arithmetic expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation)
- Evaluate postfix expressions
- Analyze algorithm complexity of stack operations

The project strengthens understanding of the Stack ADT, generic programming, expression parsing, and C++ STL containers.

## Files Included

- `stack.h`: Stack class template interface (namespace `cop4530`)
- `stack.hpp`: Stack class implementation
- `in2post.cpp`: Main program for expression conversion and evaluation
- `assignment6_p3.txt`: Time complexity analysis for `clear()` and postfix evaluation
- `makefile`: Compiles the project
- `test_stack1.cpp`: Test driver for validating stack functionality

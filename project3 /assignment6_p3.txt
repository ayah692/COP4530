 Complexity Analysis of clear() in Stack and evaluatePostfix

1. Complexity of clear() in Stack:
   - The Stack class uses std::vector as the underlying container.
   - The clear() function calls std::vector::clear(),The clear function runs through each entry and destroys which has a time complexity of O(n), 
     where n is the number of elements in the vector.
   - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of Stack::clear() is:
     O(n)

2. Complexity of evaluatePostfix:
   - The evaluatePostfix function processes a postfix arithmetic expression by iterating through each token.
   - Each token is either pushed to the stack (for operands) or involves a few pop and push operations (for operators).
   - Since each of these stack operations (push, pop, top) is O(1), the time complexity for processing each token is O(1).
   - If there are m tokens in the expression, the function performs O(m) operations in total.
   - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of evaluatePostfix is:
     O(m)
